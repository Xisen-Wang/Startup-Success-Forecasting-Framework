# Startup Success Forecasting Framework (SSFF)

The Startup Success Forecasting Framework (SSFF) is a pioneering approach designed to automate the evaluation of startup success potential. Leveraging a blend of traditional machine learning models, Large Language Models (LLMs), and real-time market data analysis, SSFF aims to transform the landscape of venture capital investment by providing deep, actionable insights into the viability of early-stage startups.

## What This Repo Includes

- **Data Exploration Files:** Scripts and notebooks for exploring and understanding the dataset used in model training.
- **Model Training Files:** Code for training the SSFF's underlying machine learning models, including random forest classifiers and neural networks.
- **Pipeline Building Files:** Implementation of the SSFF pipeline, integrating LLM analysis, feature extraction, and prediction models for comprehensive startup evaluation.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Launch a Demo Interface
- [ ] Upgrade to Version 2

## How to Run

To execute the main pipeline and analyze a startup, use the following command:

```bash
python overallPipeline.py
